# Simple Language Prediction In C++
This is a simple personal project that can predict rather input is English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish. This program learn from the same text in different languages to generate alphabet frequencies. It then cross reference the alphabet frequency generated by user input with its lists of trainning data to generate a prediction. 

### To Compile In Linux/Bash
$ g++ -std=c++14 main_2.cpp -o main_2
$ ./main_2

### Input
Text can either be entered, or be saved in input.txt. 

#### This is an example of predicting text typed directly into the program

#### To predict text saved in input.txt, simple press enter when program prompts for input

#### User can also set the threshold of difference to get a more accurate prediction, if user presses enter, threshold defaults to 4
